Changes:

LimeSDR_Mini_1v2_DB_DFMr2:
 - R44 made NF (BOM version)
 - LimeSDR_Mini_1v2_schematic_r2.PDF generated
 - LimeSDR_Mini_1v2_BOMr2.xls updated
 
LimeSDR_Mini_1v3:
 - Initial version from LimeSDR_Mini_1v2_DB_DFMr2
 - 1.8V and 3.3V rail LDOs changed
 - Capacitors C194 and C195 added for LMS power
 - HW version changed (affects only PCB physical pin connection)
 - BOM version changed (R44 is now fit)
 - Layout improvements (FT connection)

LimeSDR_Mini_2v0:
 - New sheet with RF diagram.
 - Updated diagrams.
 - LMS EEPROM made NF.
 - Changed RF MOSFETs (RF shunt and attenuator).
 - Connected LMS Channel 2 RXes to GND.
 - Connected Edge GPIO pin 5 to VCC5P0 instead of VCC1P8.
 - Changed FPGA from Intel 10M16SAU169C8G to Lattice LFE5U-45F-MG285.
 - Removed 10 pin 0.05" JTAG (Only Edge JTAG left).
 - HW_VER changed to 3.
 - Removed parallel termination resistors (NF) for FT_CLK line.
 - LM75 temperature sensor fit.
 - FPGA I2C EEPROM NF.
 - Added Multi-footprint (SO08N/SO08W/DFN8) FPGA configuration FLASH.
 - Removed angle LED and added TX and RX LEDs. FPGA_GPIO[7:4] are shared with TX and RX LEDs, ca be disconnected by clearing solder bridges JMP1-4.
 - Changed XO from RTX5032A to E7355LF.
 - XO DAC changed from 8 to 10 bit (from DAC5311IDCKR to DAC6311IDCK.
 - Added 16 bit XO VC DAC (NF) and 2,5V reference for XO DAC (NF).
 - Changed clock buffer CLKout2-4 Vddo to 3.3V and optimized power decoupling capacitors.
 - Added new regulator for FPGA core (1.1V).
 - VCC3P3 regulator's EN connected to VCC1P1 PG pin (power sequence).
 - Other cosmetic  changes (sheet orientation, revision, etc).
 - PCB fabrication requirements under FPGA increased: minimal copper width/spacing 3 mil (0.0762 mm), vias under FPGA reduced to 0.3mm ring/0.15mm via. Fabrication requirements for the rest of the PCB left unchanged (copper width/spacing 4mil or 0.1mm; vias 0.4mm ring and 0.2mm hole)
